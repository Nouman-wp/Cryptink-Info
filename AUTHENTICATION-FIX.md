# 🔐 Authentication & Profile System - FIXED

## ✅ All Issues Resolved

All authentication and profile-related issues have been completely fixed. Here's what was addressed:

---

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. **Multiple Wallet Sign-In Prompts** ✅

**Problem**: Users had to sign the wallet message 3-4 times to authenticate

**Root Cause**:
- `useAuth` hook had a race condition where authentication was triggered multiple times
- No flag to prevent simultaneous authentication attempts
- Token wasn't being checked from localStorage before triggering authentication

**Solution**:
- Added `isAuthenticating` ref to prevent concurrent authentication attempts
- Added `hasLoadedToken` ref to ensure localStorage is checked first
- Only auto-authenticate on the `/connect` page, not on every page load
- Improved loading states to prevent premature authentication triggers

**File Modified**: `frontend/hooks/useAuth.ts`

**Key Changes**:
```typescript
const isAuthenticating = useRef(false)
const hasLoadedToken = useRef(false)

// Prevent multiple simultaneous attempts
if (isAuthenticating.current) {
  console.log('Authentication already in progress, skipping...')
  return
}
```

---

### 2. **Authentication Not Persisting Across Pages** ✅

**Problem**: After signing in, navigating to different pages prompted for wallet signature again

**Root Cause**:
- Token was stored in localStorage but not being loaded properly on page navigation
- Authentication state was being reset on component remount

**Solution**:
- Improved token persistence with proper localStorage management
- Added token validation on component mount
- Only clear auth when wallet is explicitly disconnected

**Key Changes**:
```typescript
// Load token from localStorage on mount
useEffect(() => {
  const savedToken = localStorage.getItem('cryptink_token')
  if (savedToken) {
    setToken(savedToken)
    fetchCurrentUser(savedToken)
  }
  hasLoadedToken.current = true
}, [])
```

### 3. **Hardcoded Profile Data** ✅

**Problem**: User profile showed hardcoded placeholder data instead of real data from MongoDB

**Solution**:
- Completely rewrote profile page to use real user data from `useAuth` hook
- Integrated with backend API to fetch user stats
- Shows actual wallet address, username, bio, tags, and social links
- Displays "No data yet" prompts when profile fields are empty

**File Modified**: `frontend/app/profile/page.tsx`

**Real Data Shown**:
- Username (from MongoDB)
- Bio (from MongoDB)
- Wallet address (from authentication)
- Tags (from MongoDB)
- Social links (Twitter, GitHub, Website)
- Reputation score
- Project statistics
- Total earnings

---

### 4. **Non-Functional Edit Profile** ✅

**Problem**: Edit profile button didn't work

**Solution**:
- Created fully functional edit profile dialog with form
- Integrated with backend `/api/users/me` endpoint
- Saves all changes to MongoDB
- Shows success/error toast notifications
- Auto-refreshes page after successful update

**Features**:
- ✅ Edit username
- ✅ Edit bio (multiline textarea)
- ✅ Edit tags (comma-separated)
- ✅ Add Twitter handle
- ✅ Add GitHub username
- ✅ Add website URL
- ✅ Real-time validation
- ✅ Loading states during save
- ✅ Toast notifications for feedback

---

### 5. **Missing Toast Notifications** ✅

**Problem**: No user feedback when actions succeed or fail

**Solution**:
- Added Sonner toast library to `layout.tsx`
- Toast notifications for:
  - Profile updates (success/error)
  - Wallet address copied
  - Authentication errors
  - Form validation errors

**File Modified**: `frontend/app/layout.tsx`

```typescript
import { Toaster } from "sonner"

<Toaster position="top-right" theme="dark" />
```

## 🚀 How to Test

### Step 1: Start Backend
```bash
cd "C:\Users\nouma\OneDrive\Desktop\CryptInk V1\backend"
npm run dev
```

**Expected Output**:
```
✅ MongoDB connected successfully
🚀 Server is running on http://localhost:3000
```

### Step 2: Start Frontend
```bash
cd "C:\Users\nouma\OneDrive\Desktop\CryptInk V1\frontend"
pnpm dev
```

**Expected Output**:
```
▲ Next.js 15.2.4
- Local:        http://localhost:3001
```

### Step 3: Test Authentication Flow

1. **Open App**: http://localhost:3001
2. **Click "Connect Wallet"** in header
3. **Or go to**: http://localhost:3001/connect
4. **Select Phantom or Solflare**
5. **Sign message once** (only one signature required now!)
6. **You'll be redirected to dashboard** ✅

### Step 4: Test Profile System

1. **Go to Profile**: http://localhost:3001/profile
2. **Or click your wallet dropdown** → View Profile
3. **Click "Edit Profile"** button
4. **Fill in your information**:
   - Username: Your display name
   - Bio: Tell us about yourself
   - Tags: sci-fi, blockchain, writing
   - Twitter: @yourhandle
   - GitHub: @yourusername
   - Website: https://yoursite.com
5. **Click "Save Changes"**
6. **Success toast appears** ✅
7. **Profile updates instantly** ✅

### Step 5: Navigate Between Pages

1. **Dashboard** → No re-authentication ✅
2. **Browse** → No re-authentication ✅
3. **Profile** → No re-authentication ✅
4. **Editor** → No re-authentication ✅

Your authentication persists across all pages!

## 🔑 Authentication Flow (Improved)

```
1. User clicks "Connect Wallet"
   ↓
2. Wallet selector opens (Phantom/Solflare)
   ↓
3. User selects wallet
   ↓
4. ONE signature request (not 3-4!)
   ↓
5. Backend verifies signature
   ↓
6. JWT token issued
   ↓
7. Token saved to localStorage
   ↓
8. User data fetched from MongoDB
   ↓
9. Redirect to dashboard
   ↓
10. Token persists across all pages ✅
```

---

## 💾 Profile Data Flow

```
New User Registration:
1. Connect wallet → Sign message
   ↓
2. Backend creates user in MongoDB with:
   - walletAddress (unique)
   - username: "user_ABC123" (auto-generated)
   - reputation: 0
   - tags: []
   - bio: ""
   ↓
3. User sees default profile
   ↓
4. User clicks "Edit Profile"
   ↓
5. Fills in personal information
   ↓
6. Backend updates MongoDB document
   ↓
7. Profile shows real data ✅

Returning User:
1. Connect wallet → Sign message
   ↓
2. Backend finds existing user in MongoDB
   ↓
3. Returns JWT with user ID
   ↓
4. Frontend fetches user data
   ↓
5. Shows saved profile information ✅
```

## 📊 Database Structure (MongoDB)

```javascript
User Collection:
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  walletAddress: "7xK...9Ps" (unique, indexed),
  username: "crypto_writer",
  bio: "Passionate about Web3 writing",
  avatar: "https://...",
  reputation: 850,
  tags: ["sci-fi", "blockchain", "writing"],
  socialLinks: {
    twitter: "@cryptowriter",
    github: "@myusername",
    website: "https://mysite.com"
  },
  settings: {
    notifications: true,
    publicProfile: true
  },
  createdAt: ISODate,
  lastActive: ISODate
}
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Failed to fetch" Error
**Solution**: Make sure backend is running on port 3000
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

### Multiple Sign-In Prompts Still Appearing
**Solution**:
1. Clear localStorage: `localStorage.clear()` in browser console
2. Disconnect wallet from site
3. Refresh page
4. Reconnect wallet

### Profile Not Updating
**Solution**:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify token exists: `localStorage.getItem('cryptink_token')`
3. Check backend logs for API errors

### Toast Notifications Not Showing
**Solution**: The Toaster component is now added to layout. Clear cache and refresh.
